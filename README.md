# 📊 Student Performance Analysis

This project involves analyzing student exam performance data to categorize student results based on their average scores. It includes data loading, cleaning, creating performance labels, and visualizing insights using Python and Streamlit.

---

# 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes student scores in:
- Math
- Reading
- Writing

Along with demographic data such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, and test preparation course status.

# 🎯 Objective

To explore and analyze student performance by:
- Calculating average scores for each student
- Categorizing performance into labels: Excellent, Good, and Needs Improvement
- Creating visualizations to understand performance distribution and trends

---

# 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Streamlit  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn
- Numerize

# 🔍 Key Analyses & Visualizations

## 1. 🎓 Average Score Calculation  
Calculated the average of math, reading, and writing scores to get an overall performance metric per student.

## 2. 📊 Performance Labeling  
Students are labeled as Excellent (average > 80), Good (average between 60-80), or Needs Improvement (average < 60).

## 3. 📈 Visual Performance Insights  
Visualizations highlight the distribution of scores and how performance varies across demographics.

---

# 📌 Notable Insights

- Majority of students fall under the Good performance label.
- Performance varies based on demographic factors and preparation course completion.
- Identified trends useful for educators to focus on students needing improvement.
